  description: You've since left the mountain quite some time ago. The tree canopy
    is starting to thin and the weathered dirt path is giving way to paving stones.
    The edge of the forest is appearing in the distance as your excitement to finally
    leave the forest grows. As you walk closer a figure grows, blocking the exit
    to the forest. You approach closer and notice that a knight is standing with
    their sword drawn. "You heard the call of Avilio too? Only one can be her champion,"
    he says as he walks towards you. Seems there is no escaping this fight.
