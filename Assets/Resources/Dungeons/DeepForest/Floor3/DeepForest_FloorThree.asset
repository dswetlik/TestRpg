  description: It's been some time since you crossed swords with the bandit, and
    it seems like you've been walking in circles. There's the split rock again, that's
    the barren tree you saw half an hour ago, there's that person digging something-
    wait, that's new. He looks up and notices you staring before shouting, "You!
    Come help me dig this up and I'll give you a cut of the treasure!." He holds
    a shovel out to you.
