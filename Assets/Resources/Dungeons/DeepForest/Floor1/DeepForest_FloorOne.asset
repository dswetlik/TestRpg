  description: You battle your way through the thick brush, thankful for the clearing
    that you spotted up ahead. That is until you reach the edge of the clearing and
    spot a bear sleeping on a stump almost perfectly centered in the clearing. You
    can't imagine that picking a fight with the bear would be a good idea, but their
    hearts are a prized commodity.
