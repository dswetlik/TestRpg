  description: 'You keep following the dirt path. It seems to be getting brighter
    and brighter even though the tree canopy keeps getting thicker. It keeps getting
    brighter when you immerge into a clearing and see the source of light: a large
    mountain that you had not seen due to the tree covering. A gust of warm wind
    blows past you and you swear you hear someone whispering "Walk into the mountain,
    receive my Artifact." You look to the mountain, thinking what you should do next.'
