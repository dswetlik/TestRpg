  description: 'You enter into a dimly lit cavern and hear the distinct crackling
    of a fire and the murmur of voices bouncing off of the walls of the cave. You
    round a corner of the cavern and see two young bandits crouching at a fire. One
    jumps up and runs deeper into the cave, the other seems frozen in fear on the
    ground. '
