  description: You stuff yourself into a crevasse in the hallway in an attempt to
    hide from the shuffling corpse, hoping that it never spotted you. You release
    a sigh of relief as you hear the shuffling die in the distance, glad it didn't
    spot you. You leave your hiding place and continue down the hallway.
