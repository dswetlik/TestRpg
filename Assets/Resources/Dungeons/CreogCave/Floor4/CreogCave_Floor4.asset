  description: You leave the large gallery behind, bones crunching underneath your
    feet. You're starting to hear mumbling and murmuring again, but you can't imagine
    a bandit is this far back in the cave. Something shuffles up ahead, and a shadow
    that looks like a handle protrudes from the back. Its head shifts and seemingly
    looks at you, you can feel its intense glowing eyes burning into your eyes as
    it starts shuffling down your hallway.
