  description: You walk into a massive bright gallery, tapestries hung from the ceilings
    and bronze braziers roar with fire. In front of you sits a robed figure sitting
    in a circle of glowing runes, murmuring an incantation with her eyes closed.
    You take a step forward and her eyes open, an intense blue staring you down freezing
    you in place. Her incantation ends as she erupts into a cyclone of blue flame.
    It dies down quickly, leaving no evidence that anyone was ever sitting there.
    You've never seen magic like that.
