  description: 'You decide to walk over and investigate the glowing stones. Embedded
    into the glowing wall is an iron pickaxe and rocks scattered all over the floor.
    You kneel down and pick one of the rocks up and feel an intense magic course
    through you from the rock. "The blue glow looks fairly similar to the glow in
    that skeleton''s eyes," you think to yourself. '
