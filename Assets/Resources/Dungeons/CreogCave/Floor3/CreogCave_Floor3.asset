  description: You stand over the now scattered bones of the previously walking skeleton,
    confused as to how something like this could happen. You look up from the bones
    and notice that you're in a massive chamber with bones scattered everywhere and
    the potent stench of death. To the left there appears to be a study desk, to
    the right are some lightly glowing rocks.
