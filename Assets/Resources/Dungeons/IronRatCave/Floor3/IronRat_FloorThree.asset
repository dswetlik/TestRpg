  description: Even before you step into the main cavern of the cave, your eyes are
    watering from a strong stench of death. You peek around a corner to witness a
    gigantic rat sitting in a nest, knawing at the bones of some poor adventurer
    before you. Crouching down, you contemplate rushing the rat while it's distracted
    or wait here to come up with a better plan.
