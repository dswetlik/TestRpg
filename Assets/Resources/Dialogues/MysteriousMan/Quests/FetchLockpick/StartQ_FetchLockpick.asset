  notStartedResponse: ...actually, you look like you could be useful. Listen, I've
    accidentally misplaced all of my lockpicks in some guard's pocket. I really need
    these lockpicks, so I need you to borrow some from those bandits they keep holed
    up in the arena. Think you can do that for me?
  notCompleteResponse: Oh, that's right, got those lockpicks yet? I need them, I've
    found a lock that needs some of my assistance.

  completeResponse: Oh yeah, let me see them. These picks will do nicely. Here's
    some gold that I happened upon the road. Now go away.
