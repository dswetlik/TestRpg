  _playerLineObjectText: Necromancers...
  _playerLineResponseText: There were quite a few necromancers in the cave, they
    were raising the dead in their tombs.
  _npcLine: That is not good. I've uncovered some information, and I'm almost certain
    that the mayor is already dead, or maybe even was always dead. I don't know exactly
    what that has to do with those necromancers, but I'll keep digging to find out.
    Thank you.
