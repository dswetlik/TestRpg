  _npcLine: "If you think I understand this any more than you do right now, you're
    wrong. I might even be wrong, but everything that I've seen right now seems to

    in a cave nearby, Creog Cave as it's called by locals. Apparently it used to
    be a burial grounds of sorts. You think you can go there and check it out?"
