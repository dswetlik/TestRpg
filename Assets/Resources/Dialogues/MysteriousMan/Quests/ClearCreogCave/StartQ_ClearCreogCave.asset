  notStartedResponse: Rumor says that he is a member of a clan of necromancers settling
    into the area. Graveyards have been being pillaged and people have been disappearing
    ever since that man showed up. Visitors to Buruns have noted that they hear strange
    noises coming from the Creog Mountain. Go check that out for me, see if you can
    find anything going on there.
  notCompleteResponse: You haven't checked it out yet? You must go, we may not have
    much time left.

  completeResponse: You found risen dead, blue stones, and a woman who disappeared
    into a blue flame? Nothing connecting Temrik to this? I can't believe that. I
    need some time to think of our next move.
