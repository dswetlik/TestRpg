  _playerLineResponseText: This is all too much for me, where do I even start?
  _npcLine: That's a great question. I suppose I would start by suggesting you mee
    the most important shopkeepers around, as they'll hopefully keep you alive. Why
    don't you start by meeting the city blacksmith, Hirgird? He'll be in his shop
    down the road.
