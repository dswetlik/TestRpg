  notStartedResponse: As a matter of fact, I do. We need you to go in the arena and
    clean out some of the packs of rats. We're tired of the fights being interrupted
    by rat stampedes. Will you take this bounty?
  notCompleteResponse: The bounty is for 5 packs of rats. Get back in there and fulfill
    the bounty!
