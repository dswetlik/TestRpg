  notStartedResponse: We just got this bounty in. Somebody really hates dire wolves,
    so much so they're willing to see someone slaughter a bunch of them. It's pretty
    straightforward, are you taking this?
  notCompleteResponse: The bounty is for 5 dire wolves. Get back in there and fulfill
    the bounty!
