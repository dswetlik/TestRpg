  notStartedResponse: That's a great question. For a gladiator just thrown into this
    town, I would highly suggest getting to know the shopkeepers who will be helping
    you stay alive. Why don't you start by talking to the blacksmith, Hirgird? He'll
    be in his shop down the road!
  notCompleteResponse: Go on now, go talk to Hirgird!, stop wasting my time until
    you do!

  completeResponse: Temrik sent you? Alright, I'm the blacksmith. Come to me if you're
    in need of new armaments in your fight to the top. We'll hopefully be restocking
    with new weapons soon!
