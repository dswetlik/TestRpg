  notStartedResponse: The next shopkeeper I'd direct you to would be Invera, our
    alchemist here in Buruns. She'll be the one to go to in case you need potions,
    so it may be good to familiarize yourself with the shop.
  notCompleteResponse: Have you gone to Invera yet? No? Well get going then!
