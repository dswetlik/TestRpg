  notStartedResponse: You're at the end of the line, gladiator. All that's left is
    to take out three more enemies, our city's chief battlemage and chief knight,
    along with his trained war wolf. It's a little challenge they do to test themselves
    against the best in the arena. Are you ready?
  notCompleteResponse: You haven't taken the three out yet. Get back in there and
    fulfill the bounty!
