  npcLine: You're either going to become the new Arena Grandmaster or you will die
    trying. I assume the latter will happen. In the cheerful meantime, walk around
    Buruns and talk to the townsfolk or start honing your skills in the arena.  I
    will occasionally be handing out bounties to take out some enemies in the arena.
    Just keep checking in, I'm sure I'll have one ready for you soon!
