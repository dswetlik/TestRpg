  npcLine: Well, yes, you're a gladiator aren't you? Just go ahead and walk through
    the doors. The other arena masters will give you a choice between three enemies,
    and after choosing will send you into the arena. You can leave at any point before
    confirming your choice of enemy. Any other questions?
