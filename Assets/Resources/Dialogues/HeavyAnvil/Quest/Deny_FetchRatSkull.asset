    I would need right now.

    ...

    Actually, I''ve been looking for a new
    mantle piece. Tell you what, you bring me a rat skull and I''ll throw you a couple
    pieces of gold for the trouble.'
  notCompleteResponse: What do you mean? You don't have the skull yet? Well go get
    it then!
  completeResponse: You've already done me a great service, thank you.
