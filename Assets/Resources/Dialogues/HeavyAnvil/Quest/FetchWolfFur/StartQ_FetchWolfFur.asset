  notStartedResponse: Yes, I do. While that rat skull looks nice, my fireplace still
    looks very plain. It needs something. Maybe some form of carpetting? If you could
    bring me a wolf pelt to try, I'd be happy.
  notCompleteResponse: Don't have the wolf pelt yet? No worries, I'm still deep in
    thought about whether the wolf pelt will look nice.
  notCompleteDialogueOptions:
  - Alright, can I see your wares now?
