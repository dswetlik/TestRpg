  notStartedResponse: There's a strange fad that has been appearing across the kingdom
    that finally made its way here. These people are wearing massive furry boots.
    It looks like they're wearing two brown bears. It's not my place to mock them,
    I just need to make and sell those hideous things. The problem is that my poa--
    , hunters haven't been bringing me much fur lately. You bring me fur, I'll pay
    you well.
  notCompleteResponse: Do you have the fur yet? No? Come on, I have lots of orders
    for those boots already, get on it!
  completeResponse: You have the fur? Perfect, this will work wonderfully. I don't
    know how to thank you enough!
