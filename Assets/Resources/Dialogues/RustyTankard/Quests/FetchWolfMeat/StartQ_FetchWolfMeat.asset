  notStartedResponse: I haven't gotten it yet! I have no idea what happened to it
    or where it is, and I've finally ran out of that rat meat you brought me earlier.
    I don't want rat meat, people were starting to complain last time. Can you get
    me some wolf meat this time?
  notCompleteResponse: Food shipment? You're the one who is supposed to get me the
    meat! Go get it!

  completeResponse: Thank you for the meat, hopefully this is the last time I'll
    need this. Here's some gold for your troubles.
