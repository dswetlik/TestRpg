  _playerLineObjectText: Rat meat stew...
  _playerLineResponseText: How is the fame of your rat meat stew coming along?
  _npcLine: Believe it or not, it has become the most popular dish in Buruns and
    is starting to spread to other towns! I've started to think of another dish to
    really cement my name as a gourmand, and I've figured wolves are next. Want to
    get me ingredients again?
