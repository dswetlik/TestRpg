  notStartedResponse: Actually, I don't right now. Rats broke into my storeroom and
    ate practically everything. This may sound odd, and no one can know this, but
    I'd like you to collect some rat meat so I can make it into a stew.
  notCompleteResponse: Hey, I have some really hungry customers, can you get me that
    rat meat?
