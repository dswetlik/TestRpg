  _npcLine: My father brought us here right as the arena's construction was finished.
    We were quite a poor family, so he joined the ranks of the gladiators looking
    for fortune and fame. Fortune and fame is what he found, and he went down as
    the first Champion of this arena, the Lithe Warrior.
