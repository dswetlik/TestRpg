  _playerLineResponseText: I've seen some pretty strange furry clothes around here.
    Do you know anything about that?
  _npcLine: You can thank me for that! I saw someone wearing some furry clothes when
    I traveled abroad and just knew I had to bring them back to Buruns. They're just
    flying out of the store, and I can't keep enough fur in stick to make them! I'm
    sure you'll run across some fur, can you bring me some?
