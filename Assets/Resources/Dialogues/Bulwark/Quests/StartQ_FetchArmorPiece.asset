  notStartedResponse: Because I need to make all of it from scratch! Do you know
    how expensive ingots are now with the war in the South? None of the mines are
    producing. Hey, you know who doesn't need their armor? Dead gladiators. Bring
    me chunks of their armor and I'll reward you greatly!
  notCompleteResponse: I already told you why, now go get those armor pieces!
  notCompleteDialogueOptions:
  - Can I see your wares first?

  completeResponse: Thank you, this should help me craft some cheaper armor! Here's
    the reward I talked about.
