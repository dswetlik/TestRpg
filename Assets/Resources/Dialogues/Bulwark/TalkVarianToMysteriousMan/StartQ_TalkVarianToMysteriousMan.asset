  notStartedResponse: Special armor? I barely have enough supplies to outfit the
    guards! A question like that could only come from a newcomer to Buruns, so you
    must be that new gladiator Temrik brought in. Listen, I can't say much, but there
    is someone who can help you in this situation. You'll have to find him, he's
    around here somewhere.
  notCompleteResponse: Have you found him yet? He's somewhere in Buruns, check the
    alleyways!
