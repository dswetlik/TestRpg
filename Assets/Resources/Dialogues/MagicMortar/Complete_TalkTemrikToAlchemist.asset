  notStartedResponse: The next shopkeeper I'd direct you to would be Invera, our
    alchemist here in Buruns. She'll be the one to go to in case you need potions,
    so it may be good to familiarize yourself with the shop.
  notCompleteResponse: Have you gone to Invera yet? No? Well get going then!

  completeResponse: 'Temrik? You poor thing...

    ...

    Anyway, you come to
    me any time you think you need a potion, so long as I have one in stock. Here,
    take one on the house. Best of luck to you, gladiator.'
