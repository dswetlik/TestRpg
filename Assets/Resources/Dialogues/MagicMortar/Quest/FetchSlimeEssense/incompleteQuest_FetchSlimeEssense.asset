  _playerLineObjectText: Slime essense...
  _playerLineResponseText: Why slime essense? That seems quite the oddity for a potion.
  _npcLine: Believe it or not, the essense of a slime is an integral part to a good
    base of a potion. It holds all of the other ingredients in quite nicely, along
    with fermenting them quite readily. Where else would potions get their distictive
    colors if not from colored slimes?
