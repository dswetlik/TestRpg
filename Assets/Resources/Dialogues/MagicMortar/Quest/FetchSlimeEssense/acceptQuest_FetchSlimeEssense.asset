  _playerLineResponseText: Okay, I'll go find you some potion bases, but what exactly
    am I looking for then?
  _npcLine: Oh, of course, my apologies! A great potion base is essense from a slime.
    I'm sure you've seen them bouncing around as they do. I just need three essenses
    from each type of slime. That should tide me over until my shipment from the
    slime farm comes in.
