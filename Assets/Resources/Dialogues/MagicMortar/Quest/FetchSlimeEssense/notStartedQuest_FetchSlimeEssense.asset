  _playerLineObjectText: Any tasks for me...
  _playerLineResponseText: Do you have any tasks that I could perform?
  _npcLine: Yes, I do. Every time you new gladiators show up you get beaten into
    a pulp and drink through all of my stock of potions! I'm out of potion base now,
    and I obviously really need that to make a potion. Could you go find some for
    me?
