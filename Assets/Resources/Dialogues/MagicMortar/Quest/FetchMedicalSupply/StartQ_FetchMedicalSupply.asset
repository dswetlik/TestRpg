  notStartedResponse: They're looking okay, but I would like you to make another
    run for me if you would be willing. Also, this time I would need you to pick
    up a mortar for me as well as a magical rune to make the potions stronger this
    time. Could you do this for me?
  notCompleteResponse: They'll look a lot nicer once you get those supplies I asked
    for. Would you mind doing that for me?
