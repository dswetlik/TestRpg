  _playerLineObjectText: Hatred of rats...
  _playerLineResponseText: I'm going to guess that you still hate rats, right?
  _npcLine: What? Of course I still hate rats! The city guard...all they care about
    are the bandits in the area, not the rats at all! I even know exactly where they're
    coming from! Say, you're quite the rat slayer, you think you could clear out
    the cave yourself?
