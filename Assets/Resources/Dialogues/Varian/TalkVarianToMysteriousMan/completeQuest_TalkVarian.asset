  _playerLineObjectText: Varian sent me...
  _playerLineResponseText: Varian sent me to find you. He says you might know something
    about the assassination plot on the mayor.
  _npcLine: Varian, the armorsmith? Does he intend to be the hero of Buruns? I'll
    put to rest your worries first, I'm not a part of the plot. I have been trying
    to find who is a part of the plot, and everything I have been finding recently
    leads straight back to the mayor himself.
