  _playerLineObjectText: Assassination rumors...
  _playerLineResponseText: I've heard something about people trying to assassinate
    the mayor. Do you know anything about that?
  _npcLine: You've heard the some part of the rumors then. Supposedly, there is a
    group in Buruns plotting to assassinate the govenor. I've seen someone lurking
    in the shadows of the city recently, they might have something to do with this!
    Can you track them down and maybe 'extract' some information?
